Whip it good with my ultra-luxurious, intensive cream. Infused with super-absorbent, 100% Pure Argan Oil in a creamy, luscious shea butter base, it sinks in and nourishes itchy hands from the inside out. And the scrumptious scent is a treat for the senses. Winter or summer, it puts satin-soft hands within our grasp. Why I love it: Ive always got my hands fullout in the sun and wind, with my girls at bath time, or cooking up a stormand all that handiwork was starting to show. Thats why I was thrilled by how fast my Whipped Argan Oil Intensive Hand Cream repaired, softened, and restored the silky texture of my skin. Whats in it: 100% Pure Argan Oil, whipped to buttery perfection with rich shea butter, will soften you up in no time. With hydrating macadamia nut oil, anti-inflammatory chamomile and green tea extract, and nourishing carrot seed oil, its the most luxurious cream ever, hands-down. Whats not in it: I dont hold hands with synthetic fragrances, parabens, or sulfates that dry and irritate skin.

Just give your favorite toilet paper a few spritzes of Cooling Chamomile, use your normal wipe process, repeat as necessary with a fresh batch of toilet paper of course and your backside. Your underwear (unless you go commando, then your pants), your toilet, septic system (if you have one) and your municipal sewer system will all be thankful.
